T&D POLICY

 

Delivery

When will I get my order?

Usually, it takes 3–7 days to fulfill an order (80% of orders will be ready for shipping in less than 3 days), after which it’s shipped out. The shipping time depends on your location, but can be estimated as follows:

●  USA: 3–4 business days

●  Europe: 6–8 business days

●  Australia: 2–14 business days

●  Japan: 4–8 business days

●  International: 10–20 business days

[Covid-19] ​ When will I get my order?
Our fulfillment times [for all products/t-shirts/phone cases/etc.] may be longer than usual and may continue to increase until things get back to normal. We’re seeing delays in our supply chain, including distributors and shipping carriers as the entire industry is grappling with challenges.

Will I be charged customs for my order?

An additional customs and tax fee can occur on international orders. This fee is not in our control and is assessed by your local customs office. Customs policies vary widely for every country so please check with your local customs office directly to see if they apply duties and taxes to your purchases.

My order should be here by now, but I still don’t have it. What should I do?

Before getting in touch with us, please help us out by doing the following:

●  Check your shipping confirmation email for any mistakes in the delivery address

●  Ask your local post office if they have your package

●  Stop by your neighbors in case the courier left the package with them

If the shipping address was correct, and the package wasn’t left at the post office or at your neighbor’s, get in touch with us at [insert your support email here] with your order number.

If you did find a mistake in your delivery address, we can send you a replacement order, but shipping will be at your own cost.

How do I track my order?

What’s your return policy?

We don’t offer returns and exchanges, but if there’s something wrong with your order, please let us know by contacting us at [insert your support email here]!

Do we offer refunds?

Refunds are only offered to customers that receive the wrong items or damaged items. If any of these apply, please contact us at [insert your support email here] with photos of wrong/damaged items and we’ll sort that out for you.

Can I exchange an item for a different size/color?

At this time, we don’t offer exchanges. If you’re unsure which size would fit better, check out our sizing charts—we have one for every item listed on our store, in the product description section. Though rare, it’s possible that an item you ordered was mislabelled. If that’s the case, please let us know at [insert your support email here] within a week after receiving your order. Include your order number and photos of the mislabeled item, and we’ll send you a new one, or issue a refund!

Return Policy

Any claims for misprinted/damaged/defective items must be submitted within 4 weeks after the product has been received. For packages lost in transit, all claims must be submitted no later than 4 weeks after the estimated delivery date. Claims deemed an error on our part are covered at our expense.

Wrong Address – If you provide an address that is considered insufficient by the courier, the shipment will be returned to our facility. You will be liable for reshipment costs once we have confirmed an updated address with you (if and as applicable).

If you provide a Wrong Address and you didn’t contact us, you hereby agree that any returned orders due to the wrong shipping address or a failure to claim the shipment won’t be available for reshipping and will be donated to charity at your cost (without us issuing a refund).
